## Part 1

* Look for 0 (trail head)
* For each trail head,
  * Build a list of nodes (deduplicate) to next item in the trail (i.e. 2, 3, 4, ...)
  * Repeat the discovery of next item until `9` has found.
* Count how many nodes found in last discovery.
* Add all the nodes found in all discoveries.

## Part 2

Same as part 1, but do not deduplicate the list.
