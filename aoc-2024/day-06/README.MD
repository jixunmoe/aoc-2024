## Part 1

- Implement a "game engine" that simulates the board.
    - For each step taken, record the position and direction
    - If the position/direction combination has been visited, stop.
    - If the position is out of board, count unique positions visited.

## Part 2

- Use the points found in previous part
    - Place an extra "wall" on a point from the path.
    - See if the player can get out of the board.
    - Count the number of positions.

Improve performance:

- Multiprocessing the iteration.
